# Instructions for GitHub Push Protection

If you're seeing GitHub push protection errors about API keys in your commit history, follow these steps:

1. Visit the unblock link provided by GitHub in the error message
2. Confirm that you want to allow this secret
3. Try pushing again

Alternatively, you can rewrite your Git history to completely remove the API key, but this is more complex.
